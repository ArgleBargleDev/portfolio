<h1>Gears for Breakfast's Second Game</h1>

<p>This is the most unannounced project on here, so forgive the vagueness of this page. The only public knowledge is: this <i>isn't</i> a sequel to A Hat in Time, and it's being developed in Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>My role as the gameplay-focused arm of the design team was to develop the movement and design the movement system, along with designing and prototyping numerous other core features, and the flow of the game in general.</p>

<p>I designed and implemented a lot of pieces of content for this game, as well as the systems organizing these pieces of content, how the player comes across these pieces of content, and how these pieces of content are balanced against each other so that each piece has a unique and interesting identity... I did this for several different types of pieces of content.</p>

<p>Maybe it would be helpful to say the part of the design I <i>did not</i> work on was the level design, though I did help co-write the level design standards and guidelines.</p>
