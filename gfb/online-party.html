<h1>A Hat in Time: Online Party</h1>

<p>Online Party is A Hat in Time's ambitious 50-player online mode. In order to maintain playability throughout the game, this mode only replicates the position and animation state of the online players. Internally, this mode is called "Ghost Party", since the online players couldn't be interacted with at first. This didn't feel great, though, so we took steps to add more interaction between players.</p>

<p>I started with simple interactions like hitting other players with your umbrella, or small clouds that appear under players when they're standing on something that isn't there on another person's screen.</p>

<p>My favorite interaction is the simple ability to jump onto another player's head and bounce upward like you hit a bounce pad. I added this to allow players to have more of a helpful impact on each other, but a lot of emergent social behaviors sprung up from this, from the new group activity of players making giant towers of bouncing players, to simply bouncing on your friend's head over and over when they are AFK. It's fitting in a platformer that hopping on someone's head becomes a sort of handshake.</p>

<p>Later, I would take this a step further and allow other players to pick up and throw each other like objects. I also created as a "bubble transport" mode where one player could act as a jump target, allowing other players to jump to them from great distances, which is great assistance to cross gaps on tougher levels as long as one player can make the jump. Don't leave your friends behind!</p>

<p>These kinds of interactions solidified Online Party as a much more playful "hang out" mode, instead of something where you just compete for the highest score (though I set up a scoreboard for that too).</p>

<p>Afterwards, I developed a series of playground games for Online Party, including typical things like a "hide and seek" and "tag" mode, both of which were expanded on by the modding community in A Hat in Time's first community-developed DLC: <a href="https://ahatintime.fandom.com/wiki/Vanessa%27s_Curse_(DLC)">Vanessa's Curse</a>!</p>
