<h1>üö¢ "Ship Shape" Minigame</h1>

<p>"Ship Shape" is a minigame where the player is assigned a gradually increasing amount of tasks throughout the cruise ship. It's up to the player to run all around the ship completing deliveries, completing tasks, and try not to succumb to the pressure of needing to be in a hundred places at once as they single-handedly keep this boat afloat.</p>

<p>If the player completes enough tasks before their pressure guage hits its limit, they win! If not, the captain sends them back out to try again.</p>


<h2 id="tasks">üì® Tasks</h2>

<p>Tasks are the objects that spawn in the world during this mission (see <a href="#spawning">Task Spawning</a>). Each task has a standard Interaction Point, which can be interacted with to complete the task, which despawns the task object. On completion, tasks grant <a href="#completion">Score Points</a>.</p>

<p>Each task has an expiration timer which starts ticking down when the task spawns. If this timer reaches zero, the task fails, despawning the task and increasing the <a href="#pressure">Pressure Meter</a>. Expiration time is based on how long it's estimated for the player to reach the task. This time should have a minimum value, so players are given a few seconds to react to tasks appearing if tasks spawn directly on top of the player.</p>

<p>All tasks should have standard Objective Icons, which should have screen clamping enabled. These Objective Icons should display an icon for the room the task is in and have a visual meter to show how long before the task expires. If possible, we should also display if the task is increasing the Pressure Meter, and if the task grants Score Points on completion.</p>


<h3>Task Icons</h3>

<p>All tasks have objective icons attached to them that can be seen through walls at any distance. When off screen, these icons clamp to the edge. This uses standard Objective Icon functionality.</p>

<p>To increase task visibility when spawning, the icon should play an animation and make a noise when it appears. There will be a lot of these icons on screen at once, so they should be fairly simplified.</p>


<h3>Interaction Tasks</h3>

<p>The most basic form of task is an Interaction task. These tasks complete immediately when interacted with and grant <a href="#completion">Score Points</a>. While waiting to be completed, Interaction tasks slowly add to the <a href="#pressure">Pressure Meter</a>.</p>

<p>Interaction tasks should have exposed functionality to allow design to create new tasks via Kismet, replacing the Interaction Point with unique behaviors like pulling weeds, making beds by bouncing on them, or fixing toilets by slamming their lids with the Ice Hat ability. Performing these actions will complete the task the same way a regular interaction would.</p>


<h3>Delivery Tasks</h3>

<p>Delivery tasks are tasks where you pick up an item and carry it to a destination. This is actually two tasks: the first being picking up the item, and the next task being delivering it somewhere else. This uses the <a href="#taskchains">Task Chain</a> system, but unlike typical Task Chains, this one triggers instantly (since you are now holding the item).</p>

<p>Like other tasks, the task to pick up the item increases <a href="#pressure">Pressure</a> over time while it is incomplete. However, the task to deliver the item once you have it <i>doesn't</i> increase Pressure over time. Instead, it applies a different effect (see <a href="#stacking">A Stack of Deliveries</a>).</p>

<p>Likewise, picking up the item doesn't grant <a href="#completion">Score Points</a>. You are only granted points for the delivery of the item.</p>


<h3 id="stacking">A Stack of Deliveries</h3>

<p>Since you can have multiple active Delivery tasks at the same time, Hat Kid will need to be able to carry more than one item at a time. So any additional items Hat Kid picks up should stack on top of the first one, stacking upwards. Item stacks can be unlimited height, and shouldn't have collision.</p>

<p>In order to add to the chaos of this mode and to simulate the challenge of taking on too many tasks at once, taller stacks of items should wobble around and tilt in random directions as Hat Kid moves around. The taller the stack is (up to a cap), the more it should affect Hat Kid's movement, pulling her in the stack's tilt direction. Walking in the stack's tilt direction should center it, reducing the effect temporarily. Falling from high enough should also center the tilt.</p>

<p>For ease of playability, effect of tilt should be reduced while doing special moves like jump diving, bouncing on springs, bouncing from being hit by fire, and during wall climbing.</p>

<p>Hat Kid should also have access to her full set of moves in order to navigate the ship properly (climbing, double jump, swinging her umbrella, hat abilities, etc). So instead of carrying the item with both arms like she normally does, she should carry the items in her off-hand.</p>


<h2 id="spawning">üó∫Ô∏è Task Spawning</h2>

<p>Tasks spawn randomly over time, up to a cap. When there are no tasks available, the spawn time should be sped up dramatically to reduce downtime.</p>


<h3 id="taskchains">Task Chains</h3>

<p>Each task has an optional list of tasks to trigger next. This is primarily used by Delivery tasks, to link the task of picking up the item with the separate task of delivering the item. This list can be a single next task, or a list of multiple tasks to choose from, allowing Delivery tasks to be delivered to a variety of different destinations.</p>

<p>The Task Spawner should pull from these task chains when it spawns tasks, depending on what tasks are next in the chain. For example: If there's a task chain that goes from task A to B or C, then to D, and we've already completed task A, then the Task Spawner will include B or C in its pool of potential tasks to spawn next. It can't include A since it's already done, and can't include D because none of the tasks before it have been completed.</p>

<p>Additionally, each task should have a configurable amount of time before the next task in the chain can be triggered. This delay will be useful for thematic purposes, such as cooking food, or waiting for people to clean their plates.</p>

<p>Once a task chain is completed, it should be considered fresh and allowed to start over from the beginning.</p>

<p>To prevent task overlap, tasks chains that include the same tasks should be mutually exclusive. When one task chain is started, any other task chain that includes any task in that chain (without an alternate task to pick from) shouldn't be allowed to start. This will prevent task chains from fighting over tasks or muddying narrative continuity of task sequences.</p>

<p>Task Chains have a few practical thematic applications, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Placing food in an oven, taking the food out when it's cooked, delivering it to a table, and picking up the empty plates.</li>
	<li>Placing a laundry basket under a laundry chute, then placing dirty laundry and soap into a washing machine.</li>
	<li>Taking the Mafia Boss (who is currently a bunch of guts in a jar) from his room to various locations around the ship.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Spawn Priority</h3>

<p>The Task Spawner prioritizes tasks in the following ways, with each configured as a percentage chance:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid spawning tasks in rooms you were in previously (unless the room you are in is a dead end).</li>
	<li>Spawn tasks in rooms between the room you're in and the room of the most distant active task.</li>
	<li>Spawn tasks in rooms that already have a lot of tasks in them (so you can complete a bunch at once).</li>
	<li>Spawn tasks in chains that are ready to continue.</li>
	<li>Spawn tasks in the current room.</li>
</ul>

<p>This priority system should prevent things like orphaned tasks, immediate forced backtracking, and totally random pathing. There should still be some randomness, any task should still have a chance to spawn even if it breaks all of these rules, but it should be somewhat rare.</p>

<p>When combined with Task Chains, this priority system ensures your Delivery tasks will usually bring you to useful places on the map.</p>


<h3>Early Game Task Spawning</h3>

<p>For narrative purposes, we should be able to define which task is the first task assigned to the player.</p>

<p>To keep the start of the minigame from getting too hard too fast, tasks should only be able to spawn within a certain radius of the player until their score reaches a certain value (just for the first few tasks).</p>


<h2 id="difficulty">üìà Difficulty Scaling</h2>

<p>Difficulty is a percentage value that increases to 100% over an amount of time or an amount of tasks, whichever results in a lower difficulty. This ensures the player won't face an intense difficulty spike when they complete a ton of tasks really fast, and also ensures the mission won't increase in difficulty too fast over time for someone who is getting lost in the map and unable to complete tasks as fast as we expect.</p>

<p>Difficulty can also increase past 100% indefinitely, but 100% should be used as a reference point for mission configuration and balance, and should reflect the upper limit of what we expect from the usual player.</p>

<p>High Difficulty has the following effects on gameplay:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Task spawn cap is increased dramatically.</li>
	<li>Pressure gained over time from unstarted tasks is increased.</li>
	<li>Tasks take longer to expire/fail (since there's a lot more of them to juggle).</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="pressure">üå°Ô∏è Pressure Meter</h2>

<p>There is a persistent Pressure Meter on your HUD that tracks your current amount of stress. Pressure increases when tasks fail, and is reduced when tasks grant Score Points. This Pressure change is reduced based on how many active tasks there are on the map, so each individual task success/failure matters less when there are a lot of other tasks in play.</p>

<p>Pressure also constantly gradually increases for each unstarted Delivery task or untouched Interaction task. If there are no tasks that fit this criteria (for example: if you are holding all of the Delivery tasks and none are waiting to be picked up) Pressure will stop gradually increasing.</p>

<p>The higher your Pressure Meter is, the angrier it looks, and the faster the music speed becomes. This adds a frantic feeling that should make the purpose of this meter clear.</p>

<p>When the Pressure Meter reaches maximum, the mission ends. Whether you have succeeded or failed the mission is decided in the next section.</p>


<h2 id="completion">üèÜ Score Points and Mission Completion</h2>

<p>For each task you complete, you get a Score Point. Score Points are displayed on your HUD.</p>

<p>This minigame has two modes: Campaign and Death Wish. In Campaign mode, there is a Score Goal displayed on your HUD, and reaching it ends the mission. In Death Wish mode, there is a Score Goal, but it isn't displayed on the HUD (it's displayed on the Death Wish HUD instead), and the mission continues indefinitely until your Pressure Meter reaches maximum (this allows you to go for a high score, which is also tracked by the Death Wish system).</p>

<p>When the mission ends, either by reaching the Score Goal or by reaching maximum Pressure, the mission will succeed if you've met the Score Goal and will fail if you haven't. Succeeding the mission spawns the Time Piece and ends the level.</p>
