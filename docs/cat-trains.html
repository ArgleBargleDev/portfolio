<h1 id="trains">üê± Cat Trains</h1>

<p>A Cat Train is a long curvy train pulled by a large cat. These are meant to travel all around Nyakuza Metro, serving as a moving platform for the player to ride on.</p>


<h2>Cat Train Structure</h2>

<p>Cat Trains are large, wide enough for the player to comfortably run around on, and tall enough for them to wall-climb up (see <a href="#climbtrain">Climbing Up Trains</a> for more info). The trains are long and curvy, but are one single connected platform that the player can freely run down the length of without needing to jump.</p>

<p>To achieve this curve, the trains will probably need to be a skeletal mesh with bones, with the collision geometry made of several chopped-up platforms that follow the train's curved path. This geometry should be dense enough that the player doesn't notice they're not running along a big snake.</p>

<p>At the front of the train is a big cat. The cat isn't part of the main platform, and you shouldn't have physical geometry. Touching the cat will do damage (see <a href="#traindamage">Train Damage</a> for more info).</p>


<h2>Cat Train Movement</h2>

<p>Cat Trains follow a single linear looping track layout (see <a href="#tracks">Track Points</a> for more info). Since Cat Trains stay on a single path, any branching paths will be done by having two Cat Trains driving parallel to each other, allowing the player to jump between them.</p>

<p>Cat Trains can be set to travel at different speeds, but a single train should never speed up or slow down, and shouldn't stop. This consistent speed will keep the pace of the level up and prevent the player from being caught off guard by speed changes while they're platforming.</p>

<p>For more info on train movement along the track, see the section on <a href="#tracks">Being Damaged by Trains</a>.</p>


<h2>Player Interactions</h2>

<h3>Jumping On Trains</h3>

<p>The player's primary interaction with the trains is riding on them. These are essentially large moving platforms, so we should similarly attach the player when they land on them.</p>

<p>Unlike normal moving platforms, the player should stay attached to these platforms when they jump. For example: if the player jumps when the train is taking a sharp curve, the player will simply be pulled around the curve, landing in the same spot on the train they jumped from. This will prevent the player from falling off the train when they jump to dodge hazards.</p>

<p>To facilitate players jumping off the train, the player should detach from the train when they aren't above it anymore, or if we detect from input that the player is intentionally jumping away from the train. If possible, this attachment should be eased out gradually, so the transition of velocity isn't jarring and isn't triggered accidentally.</p>

<p>When jumping off a train, the player should inherit all of the train's velocity. This will give players a lot of fun airtime as well as being physically appropriate.</p>


<h3 id="climbtrain">Climbing Up Trains</h3>

<p>The player should be able to climb up the side of the train, like a regular wall.</p>

<p>To avoid being dragged around by the train while climbing up the wall, the player shouldn't be attached to the wall while climbing, and should instead climb up the moving train as if it's a static wall. To prevent the player from ever falling short on the climb and sliding back down, the train's wall climb distance should be set to unlimited.</p>

<p>When the player reaches the top of the wall and enters the ledge-vault state, they should attach to the train. Attaching to the train immediately (instead of waiting until the player lands from the ledge-vault) will prevent the player from falling off the end of the train while they aren't in control of the character.</p>


<h3>Player's Camera On Trains</h3>

<p>While on a train, the player's camera should rotate with the turning of the train. The player still has full camera control, but when the train turns, this turn is added to the camera. In order to prevent motion sickness, this turning should be yaw-only. We should also be able to toggle this feature off, for short trains where the player is expected to quickly jump across rather than ride on.</p>

<p>Some trains will require the player's immediate attention when boarding (for example: fast trains with immediate incoming hazards). So for these trains, there should be an option to quickly rotate the player's camera to face the direction of the train when they initially land on it. Most trains won't need this, and we should avoid turning this on for trains that face opposite directions, to avoid giving the player whiplash.</p>


<h3 id="traindamage">Being Damaged by Trains</h3>

<p>If the player touches the cat at the front of the train, it should damage the player and knock them to the closest side of the train, out of its path.</p>

<p>Touching the front of the train behind the cat should also damage the player, but only if they aren't jumping, in which case the player should trigger a wall climb on the front of the train, climbing up it safely. Unlike wall climbs on the side of the train, the player should attach to the front of the train during the climb (so they aren't pushed around by the train).</p>

<p>When the player is directly in front of the train, to prevent the player from being caught off guard and warn them of the danger, the cat should meow loudly and shake the screen.</p>

<p>Like all hazards, trains should have an optional Fall Recovery Point the player is teleported to when they take damage. This will prevent the player from being stuck in a weird spot they aren't supposed to be.</p>


<h1 id="tracks">üöû Cat Train Tracks</h1>

<p>All Cat Trains follow Cat Train Tracks. These tracks are visible in the world, to show the player the routes of each of the trains. Since the Cat Trains can curve, these tracks should also be curvy in nature.</p>


<h2>Player Interactions</h2>

<p>Since we want the player to run on the trains, not the tracks, there shouldn't be any player interaction with the tracks. When the player tries to touch the tracks, they should just fall straight through them.</p>

<p>In order to frame this, the tracks should look like the player can't stand on them. We could accomplish this by making the train tracks out of transparent light, having them disappear when the player gets too close, making them out of narrow strips of metal that look too sparse for the player to land on, or other similar methods.</p>


<h2>Track Points and Track Setup</h2>

<p>Tracks are set up using Track Points placed in the world. Each track point is linked to the next track point it connects to, forming the track. Trains can't switch tracks, so each track is a single linear loop of points.</p>

<p>Track points generate a curved path that passes smoothly through each point, which is displayed in the editor. In the editor, a track spline mesh can be generated to match the curve of the points.</p>

<p>Cat Train actors are also placed in the world, and linked to the track point they will start at. Trains connected to a track will follow the same curve as they loop around the track.</p>


<h3>Duplicate Trains</h3>

<p>For ease of setup, Cat Trains can be configured to have a number of duplicates. These duplicates spawn at runtime, placing themselves evenly spaced on the same track as the original train.</p>

<p>Duplicate trains should be used whenever a player would have to wait more than a few seconds for the train to circle back to them.</p>


<h3>Teleport Points</h3>

<p>Track points can be configured to teleport the train to the next track point instead of creating a curved path. When the train hits this point, it's teleported straight to the next point, where it continues following the rest of the track.</p>

<p>These should be used in any place where the train exits and re-enters the map, in order to reduce train wait time and avoid having any trains existing where they aren't visible.</p>


<h3>Sync Points</h3>

<p>In order to facilitate jumping from train to train, trains need to be kept in sync. To achieve this, two track points can be configured to be synced with each other. This offsets the train positions on the tracks so they will hit the synced track points at the exact same time.</p>

<p>Since tracks are usually different lengths, this should be achieved by slowing down the train on the shorter track. If either track has a teleport point, instead of adjusting train speed, the train on the shorter track should wait at the teleport point for the duration of the difference in track length.</p>

<p>If trains have duplicates, simply setting the same number of duplicates on each synced track should sync them appropriately without any extra work. However, if one track has duplicates while the other doesn't, the syncing system should still try and sync each train, by either slowing down the duplicates, or making them wait at teleport points.</p>

<p>For fine tuning, each train should have a time offset which can be configured to manually tweak the positions of the trains after they are synced. This will allow us to better author the timing of jumps between trains. This offset should be propagated to all duplicate trains when they are created, so they remain the same distance apart.</p>

<p>Creating a loop of synced tracks (for example: track A synced with track B synced with track C synced with track A) would likely cause an infinite loop of track corrections and should not be supported if this is the case. Creating this type of track sync should trigger a warning in the editor.</p>


<h1 id="signs">üöß Train Sign Hazard</h1>
<p>The Train Sign is a stationary hazard that can be placed above trains, giving the player something to dodge to the side or jump over while riding the Cat Trains.</p>

<h2>Appearance and Placement</h2>
<p>Train Signs are large glowing billboards. They should be very high-visibility, since they will be coming at the player fast and will deal damage if the player hits them. The art displayed on the billboards can be anything, but there should be several colors/styles to choose from, for situations where multiple billboards are placed densely and need to be identified apart from each other.</p>
<p>While signs can be made in any shape, they should generally follow an archetype of Tall and Short signs. Short signs should be no taller than half the player's jump height, so they can safely jump over them. Tall signs should be much taller than the player's jump, so they player doesn't think they can jump over them, and should be placed to the side of the train, so the player can manuever around them. These archetypes will make it more clear to the player how to react to different signs.</p>
<p>Train Signs should be placed as tightly with the top of the train as possible, so that there is no gap. This will help the player's depth perception. In situations where the signs cannot be placed tightly with the train, the signs should cast a glowing shadow directly downward onto the top of the train, so the player can see the sign's depth.</p>

<h2>Player Interaction</h2>
<p>When the player hits the sign, they take damage and are knocked away from the sign. The type of knock-back applied to the player should be configured per-sign, from the behaviors in the list below. The knockback height and distance should also be configurable.</p>

<h3>Train Sign Knock-Back Behaviors</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Knock Away:</b> Player is knocked directly away from the center of the sign. Only use this behavior if there is no other safe place to knock the player towards, since it can lead to subsequent hits or uncomfortable physics.</li>
	<li><b>Knock to Left Side:</b> Player is always knocked to the left side of the sign. Use this when the left side of the sign where you wanted the player to go, or if you want to eject the player towards the left.</li>
	<li><b>Knock to Right Side:</b> Player is always knocked to the right side of the sign.</li>
	<li><b>Knock to Automatic Side:</b> Player is knocked to the left or right side, whichever is closest. If there is a blocking wall on that side, the player will be knocked to the opposite side instead.</li>
	<li><b>Knock Over:</b> Player is knocked upwards and over the sign. Use this for short signs you usually jump over.</li>
	<li><b>Smash Through (Default):</b> Player isn't knocked at all. Instead, the player passes straight through the sign when damage is dealt and a sign-shattering particle is spawned. Use this when disrupting the player's movement would result in subsequent sign hits. Since this is the safest option in most cases, this is the default behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the player is moving at a low speed (when not riding a train), the sign should act as a regular physical object and apply no changes to the player state when touched.</p>

<p>Like most hazards, signs should be configurable with a Fall Recovery Point, teleporting the player to a safe location after taking damage. This will prevent the player from either falling into a damage pit or falling somewhere they can't recover from. This shouldn't be set on signs that use a knock-back behavior that keeps them on the train (in which case, regular Fall Recovery Volumes should be used).</p>
