<p>Essentially a love letter to old gameboy games like Link's Awakening, but unlike a typical Zelda game, it's much more combat-focused than puzzle-focused, like Castlevania or Bloodborne.</p>

<p>I was brought in to round out the design team, mostly focusing on level design and populating levels with content, charming encounters, engaging secrets, dynamic ambushes, story moments with incidental dialogue and environmental storytelling, and of course lots of things to swing your whip at.</p>

<p>As a gameboy-styled retro game, there were a lot of unique design rules we had to keep in mind. The most persistent of these was managing screen transitions. We had a mix of single screens, scrolling screens, and multi-scrolling screens, so we had to place the exits of every screen in these sweet spots where the camera wouldn't lurch when transitioning between rooms with different camera bounds.</p>

<p>Some of these areas were pretty dense with screens, so most of the content had to be designed around avoiding putting exits along half of the screen. To make things more complex, the game also has a lot of verticality despite being a top-down 2D game, so fitting all the necessary tiles to correctly fake height and depth onto those smaller screens was a real challenge! It quickly became second-nature, but every now and then there'd be a screen that requires a lot of shuffling around to get it right.</p>

<p>My tenure on this game was a little less than a year, but we made a lot of headway in that time, and I'm glad I was able to help when we needed it.</p>
