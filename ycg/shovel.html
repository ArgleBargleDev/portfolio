<p>This project only has a few teasers and press releases, so there's not much public information I can share.</p>

<p>So according to a press release, this is "a brand new mainline Shovel Knight game" that features "electrifying action, richer mechanics, and all the timeless charm you expect from a Shovel Knight title." "It's a bold new adventure that will launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension" that "that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics." Sounds great!</p>

<p>My role on the design team was to prove out all the major areas of the game, writing up a bunch of docs on various movement mechanics, enemies, objects, and environments, roughing out artistic and functional level designs, and laying as much groundwork as I could to unblock teams and ease burnout.</p>

<p>I was also involved in designing and prototyping several core movement mechanics, working tightly with the programming team and other designers to ensure what we made was in the best state it could be with our combined knowledge and expertise. There's a certain titular mechanic we polished to a mirror sheen, balancing wild exciting movements with fluidity and ease of control (but you'll have to take my word on it since it's a huge spoiler).</p>
