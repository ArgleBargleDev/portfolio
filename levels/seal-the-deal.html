<h1>"So You're Back From Outer Space"</h1>

<p>As part of A Hat in Time's Death Wish mode, I was tasked with creating a lot of remixes of various existing levels. "So You're Back From Outer Space" is a remix of the game's first jumping tutorial, where the scary alien Hat Kid chases the poor mafia around this scaffolding.</p>

<p>Since the original level was very short, I developed an all new segment that starts where the original level ends and circles around the island! This segment begins at the ramp leading to the cannon, shown in the video's level intro. Since this is one of the first Death Wish levels, I wanted to lure players into a false sense of security by keeping the original level mostly the same (except for a few additional enemies) before surprising them with the new content.</p>

<p>This level is one of the earliest Death Wish levels and is built to test a variety of skills that will be useful in the later levels.</p>

<!--
skills to go over:
- platform timing: the swinging wrecking balls and quick falling platforms. note that there's platforms under the wrecking balls to help with depth perception. the cranes were already in the level, a lot of this level's design was informed by what just happened to be nearby.
- enemy avoidance: there are a lot more enemies in Death Wish, and you are timed in a lot of levels. avoiding the enemies in this level is the only way to achieve the "beat this in XX seconds" bonus objective.
- high jump aiming: umbrella bounce pads on top of the junk towers. one of them is a moving target.
- random chaos: the final test is how the player deals with chaos of the homing rockets. your mobility is a bit low while on the tightropes, so it's a bit more of a challenge than usual. this is the festival district of town, so it made sense to pull in these homing fireworks from later in the game.

<h1>Death Wish: Challenge Levels</h1>

<p>The core concept of Death Wish was scary challenges that make the player sweat. Bombastic situations thought up by Snatcher, a trickster character who simply wants you dead. Basically, it's a difficult mode for players who thought A Hat in Time was too easy.</p>

<p>While I could have just added a few enemies and called it a day, Snatcher is a true sadist and a fan-favorite character, so I wanted to capture his personality in the mode. This meant the levels had to be flashy and panic-enducing, where the player would turn a corner and be faced with something really over-the-top and dramatic. This way, when the player overcomes these challenges, they get a more intense feeling of relief and triumph.</p>

<p>A Hat in Time has very tight controls and a lot of mobility, so this mode was designed to test the upper limits of what the character is capable of. As such, it developed a dedicated cult following of people who sought to complete all 111 challenges. Even though it came out in 2018, the Death Wish challenge scene is still alive years later!</p>
