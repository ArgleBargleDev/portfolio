<h1>Death Wish: Challenge Levels</h1>

<p>Included in A Hat in Time: Seal the Deal is the challenging "Death Wish" mode. For Death Wish, I was tasked with creating a lot of high-difficulty content, 111 challenges spanning all the levels of the base game.</p>

<p>The core concept of Death Wish was scary challenges that make the player sweat. Bombastic situations thought up by Snatcher, a trickster character who simply wants you dead. Basically, it's a difficult mode for players who thought A Hat in Time was too easy.</p>

<p>While I could have just added a few enemies to these levels and called it a day, Snatcher is a true sadist and a fan-favorite character, so I wanted to capture his personality in the mode. This meant the levels had to be flashy and panic-enducing, where the player would turn a corner and be faced with something really over-the-top and dramatic. This way, when the player overcomes these challenges, they get a more intense feeling of relief and triumph.</p>

<p>A Hat in Time has very tight controls and a lot of mobility, so this mode was designed to test the upper limits of what the character is capable of. As such, it developed a dedicated cult following. Even though it came out in 2018, the Death Wish challenge scene is still alive years later!</p>


<h1>"So You're Back From Outer Space"</h1>

<p>One of my favorite Death Wish levels, "So You're Back From Outer Space", is a remix of the game's first jumping tutorial, where the scary alien Hat Kid chases the poor mafia around this scaffolding.</p>

<p>Since the original level was very short, I developed an all new segment that starts where the original level ends and circles around the island! This segment begins at the long jump to the cannon (0:40 seconds into the video). Since this is one of the first Death Wish levels, I wanted to lure players into a false sense of security by keeping the original level mostly the same (except for a few additional enemies) before surprising them with the new content.</p>

<p>This level is one of the earliest Death Wish levels and is built to test a variety of skills that will be useful in the later levels. Lets review what we've learned:</p>

<h2>Platform Timing</h2>

<p>These swinging wrecking balls and the quickly-falling platforms after them are there to test platform timing. In Death Wish, there are quite a few times when it's dangerous to stay on a platform for even a second, so I wanted to teach the player early to stay in the air.</p>

<p>As an aside: those platforms under the wrecking balls are there to help with depth perception, allowing you to see exactly where they cross your path in 3D space. While Death Wish is cruel, it's also accessible!</p>

<h2>Enemy Avoidance</h2>
<img src="images/ufo_mafia.png" style="width:100%;"/>

<p>There's a lot of enemies in Death Wish. They're not too tough, but stopping to fight every enemy in Death Wish will often get you killed, or cause you to fail bonus objectives. Avoiding the enemies in this map is the only way to achieve the bonus objective to beat this level in 80 seconds!</p>

<h2>High Jump Aiming</h2>
<img src="images/ufo_umbrellas.png" style="width:100%;"/>

<p>These umbrella bounce pads require you to aim a few tricky high jumps that are also fairly long distance. These jumps require the combined use of all of Hat Kid's mid-air moves, double jump, air dive, and dive cancelling. Since Death Wish requires you to be in the air a lot, mastering these moves is key to mastering the game.</p>

<p>To throw a little spin on it, the last junk tower starts tilting back and forth when you get near it. This isn't much more difficult, but it gives the player a fun moment of panic which is Death Wish's style.</p>

<h2>All of The Above</h2>
<img src="images/ufo_fireworks.png" style="width:100%;"/>

<p>The final test I put the player through is basically a combination of all the other tests. Once you hit the festival district of town, the firework rockets (taken from a later level) start homing in on you, and your only platforms are these tightropes that make you move really slow and some platforms with UFOs guarding them in the distance. Your only option is to stay off the ground, avoid the enemies, and use all your airborne moves to cut through the chaos and reach the goal!</p>
