<h1>"Metro City Midnight"</h1>

<p>Metro City Midnight is a level I developed as a free add-on for A Hat in Time, releasing after Nyakuza Metro. I had a lot of ideas left over after I finished Pink Paw Manhole, so I decided to build a level out of them. This is my favorite level I made for A Hat in Time, and I have a lot to say about every part of it, so the video below has a developer commentary!</p>

<h1>"Pink Paw Manhole"</h1>

<p>Pink Paw Manhole is a challenge level I made that branches off of the Pink Paw district of Nyakuza Metro. The manhole challenges were what the design team was working on while the art teams finished up the main area of Nyakuza Metro, so for this level I did all the level art and set dressing myself, using assets from elsewhere in the metro. Most of my time during Nyakuza Metro was spent developing the Cat Trains and other gameplay mechanics, but this level turned out to be a fan favorite, so I'm very glad I found time to make it!</p>

<h1>Nyakuza Metro Secret Area</h1>

<p>It's common knowledge that there's actually a secret challenge in this level. If you press all the red buttons after completing the main objective of Pink Paw Manhole, a door opens and you enter a Death Wish themed train route! This routes a little more challenging than the others, and includes a lot of Death Wish's signature dramatic flair.</p>
