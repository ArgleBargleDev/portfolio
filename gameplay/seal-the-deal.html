<h1>Death Wish: Boss Fights</h1>

<p>I love boss fights, so one of my driving forces while working on A Hat in Time's Death Wish mode was to create a remixed fight for each major boss in A Hat in Time. These fights were designed to be super challenging, and often require the player to dodge a primary and secondary hazard at the same time.</p>

<p>But these are only a few of Death Wish's 111 challenges! For more info, see <a href="../levels/seal-the-deal.html">Death Wish: Challenge Levels</a>!


<h1>Arctic Cruise: Ship Shape</h1>

<p>This minigame is the core mechanic of the Arctic Cruise level, which was the campaign mode of A Hat in Time's Seal the Deal DLC.</p>

<p>This mission puts Hat Kid in charge of picking up the slack of the incompetent-but-cute crew of a cruise ship. As the mission progresses, more and more things go wrong throughout the ship, and it's up to you to run back and forth picking up tasks before they grow stale and finishing them before they expire.</p>

<p>This minigame is all about stress management and prioritization. As the game goes on, tasks can quickly pile up. Only tasks you haven't started on will increase your stress meter, but picking up too many tasks makes Hat Kid wobble around, which makes it harder to complete all the tasks you've started. So you have to prioritize and not take on more than you can handle, even if it means letting a few tasks fail, as well as prioritizing completing tasks to reduce stress when the stress meter is high.</p>
