<h1 id="cattrains">Cat Trains</h1>

<p>The main hook of Nyakuza Metro are these big snake-like trains pulled by gigantic cats. It was my primary duty during development of Nyakuza Metro to make these things work, make them fun to jump on, and make them easy to set up in the level.</p>

<!--TODO: add a video and some more information here.-->

<p>Since these cat trains are a level mechanic, they are featured heavily in the <a href="../levels/nyakuza-metro.html">Nyakuza Metro Level Design</a> section of my portfolio. Or if you want a detailed breakdown of how they work, check out the <a href="../docs/cat-trains.html">Cat Train Design Doc</a>!</p>


<h1 id="alleycats">Enemy: Alley Cats</h1>

<p>I made these alley cats as a general purpose enemy in the Nyakuza Metro. We already have a version of these cats that turn invisible, but they aren't particularly fun to fight against. These cats don't turn invisible, but they have a lot of new movement behaviors to pressure the player from a variety of angles.</p>

<p>Like the invisible version of this enemy, these cats can also steal your hat. What's new for this version of the enemy is the movement strategy of the cat that stole your hat. After he steals your hat, the thief cat will scan the area of allies that are hiding out of sight and run to hide with them. This leads the player into an ambush, where all the cats are alerted once they have vision on you.</p>

<p>From there, the attacking cats will circle you, attacking from various angles before backing off. To keep the player from being overwhelmed, much like the Nyakuza Thug enemies, the rate of attacks is based on how many other cats are nearby. During the fight, the thief cat will keep their distance from you, and will let the other cats attack. This creates a dynamic fight where the player is just trying to get their hat back and these other hostile cats are standing in her way.</p>

<p>Once all the attacking cats are defeated, the cat with your hat will stop running away and start attacking you himself, since I didn't want the player to have to chase him down after winning the fight.</p>


<h1 id="nyakuza">Enemy: Nyakuza Thugs</h1>

<p>The Metro Cats are a common fixture of the Nyakuza Metro, generally acting as civilians in the area. During the finale, these cats equip Nyakuza masks and reveal they were working for the gang the whole time.</p>

<p>I made these enemies for the Nyakuza Metro finale's escape sequence, where Hat Kid is chased out of the city. Since you are meant to run away from these enemies, not fight them, their design had to be a bit different from a standard enemy.</p>

<h5>Nyakuza Thugs Enemy Demo</h5>

<p>The Nyakuza Thug enemies are invincible, and will circle around Hat Kid menacingly, lunging at her to attack. Since there were going to be large crowds of these enemies, I designed them to take crowding into account, and only two of them will be openly hostile towards the player at any given moment, while the others stay in their circling pattern.</p>

<p>Since Hat Kid is very mobile and will be running away from these enemies most of the time, it was difficult to keep these enemies feeling threatening if they simply trailed behind you off screen. So I made them lunge at her from a great distance, closing the gap immediately. This way, even if you are running away from them at full tilt, you will still see them nipping at your heels, popping into frame briefly to attempt an attack. They also had to be able to follow you as you jump from platform to platform, which was a first for A Hat in Time!</p>


<h1 id="catvacuum">Cat Vacuum Bounce Pads</h1>

<p>These cat-shaped vacuums were designed to be omni-directional springpads. Designing and implementing these was handled by a few different developers, but my role in this was to set up their directional bouncing behavior.</p>

<p>Hitting the vacuums on the wall launches you upwards, but also mirrors your velocity off the wall like more of a bounce. This gives the vacuums some fun momentum to play with.</p>

<p>In places where these needed to launch you to specific platforms, I set up a system where you can define several authored landing points in the world. When bouncing off the vacuum, it will pick the destination point that matches your trajectory the closest. The result is a somewhat unique bounce pad that preserves the feeling of having control over your trajectory and momentum.</p>


<h1 id="onlineparty">Online Party Interactivity</h1>

<p>Online Party is A Hat in Time's ambitious 50-player online mode. In order to maintain playability through the game, this mode only replicates the position and animation state of the online players. This mode is internally called "Ghost Party", since by default the online players couldn't be interacted with. This didn't feel great, though, so steps were taken to add more interaction between players.</p>

<p>My involvement in this mode was primarily adding more ways for players to interact. It started with simple interactions like hitting other players with your umbrella, or small clouds that appear under players when they're standing on something that isn't there on another person's screen.</p>

<p>But my favorite interaction is the simple ability to bounce off another player when you jump on their head. I added this mostly for fun, but "other players are platforms" created a lot of emergent interactions between players. Suddenly they were making towers of players bouncing on each other's heads, players jumping on other players to reach higher platforms, bouncing on your friend's head while they're AFK, all sorts of stuff.</p>

<p>Later, I would take this a step further and allow other players to pick up and throw each other too! As well as a "bubble transport" mode where one player could act as a target, allowing other players to jump to them from great distances, which is great assistance on tougher levels.</p>

<p>These kinds of interactions solidified Online Party as a much more playful mode than something where you compete in levels (though I also designed a scoreboard for that too).</p>

<p>From there, I developed a series of "playground games" for Online Party. This included things like a "hide and seek" and "tag" mode, both of which were expanded on by the modding community in A Hat in Time's first community-developed DLC: Vanessa's Curse!</p>
