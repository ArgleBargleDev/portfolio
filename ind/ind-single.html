<p>Something I enjoy is experimenting with control schemes that are slightly off-standard. Most games about traversal will have a kind of rhythm that is unique to them. Triple jumps in Mario 64, dive cancels in A Hat in Time, bullet jumping in Warframe, etc. These rhythms become part of your muscle memory as you play, and you become hungry for them when you play games that don't have them.</p>

<p>Sometimes off-standard control schemes are just a nuisance, like this one, but it's fun to try out new rhythms!</p>

<h3>Jump n' Slide</h3>

<p>One of these rhythms I've been messing with is this jump-slide-jump pattern. The way it works is simple: you hold the button to crouch, release the button to jump. Where it gets interesting is crouching preserves your momentum and has very low friction, so landing from a jump puts you into an accelerated slide, which gives you the speed and angle to launch into another jump.</p>

<p>Sliding around in a controlled drift is always fun. Surrendering control in exchange for speed is a core concept in fun traversal, and nothing embodies that as much as a good slide move. I've built bunch of these and they always come out a bit different. There's no recipe, just get rid of the friction and then iterate until it plays well!</p>

<h3>Slammin' and Jammin'</h3>

<p>Since this is all about jumping and sliding, most of the slide momentum comes from the jump. When you press the jump button again in the air, you slam quickly, and you convert a portion of this momentum into forward velocity. If you time your jumps and measure your turns, you can preserve this momentum and build up more of it with subsequent jumps! The primary skill expression of this rhythm (and most rhythms really) is this preservation of momentum.</p>

<h3>Jump Lock-On</h3>

<p>Auto-aiming mechanics are a bit contentious. I took the opportunity here to add auto-aim to the slam move, so you can land on even tiny little pins. I'm not sure I like this feature, but it was interesting to try!</p>

<p>It's nice to make difficult moves effortless, but effort is a large part of what drives challenge. Even small things like jumping onto a narrow stump or stepping onto a box can be fun, so automating it isn't something I'd normally do. It takes a bit of the fun out of it.</p>

<p>Of course, when the fun is taken out of mundane things, you have an opportunity to raise the stakes and have fun on a grander scale! Why jump on one stump when you can jump on a <i>whole bunch</i> of stumps? Cost, mostly. Stumps are expensive.</p>

<h3>Grinding</h3>

<p>Any time you make a control scheme that feels a bit skateboardy, the concept of "grinding" comes up. I'm not a huge fan of grind rails or ziplines, since they tend to be long and are mostly used to take control away from the player. Short ones are kinda cool though. A short grind rail is just a weird timed platform, and those are fun.</p>

<p>Grinding actually emerged organically in this prototype, as a consequence of the lock-on jump system and the mechanism that prevents the player from sliding off ledges. When contextualized as grinding, these weird edge-snapping behaviors make a lot more sense.</p>
