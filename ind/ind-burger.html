<h1>Burger Bandit</h1>

<p>Burger Bandit is a hidden role card game for 4 to 9 players, where each player is a good kid eagerly preparing for the Burger Party. However, hidden in their ranks is the nefarious Burger Bandit, a grown-ass man who is trying to steal all the hamburgers for himself! It's up to all the good children to identify which of them is the Burger Bandit and stop him before he can ruin the Burger Party. Be careful though, he may not be operating alone...</p>

<p>This game is still in active development and, like the game itself, shrouded in secrecy!</p>

<p>Here's some trivia to whet your whistle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each game is about 10-30 minutes long. Resources dwindle over time, so the game is always rolling toward a victory of some sort.</li>
<li>Every action can be interpreted as innocent or villainous. There are no dead giveaways! It all comes down to social deduction and who cracks under the mounting pressure.</li>
<li>The win rate between the good and evil teams is 52% in favor of evil, and 53% of games end in violence.</li>
<li>The shortest recorded game was 32 seconds.</li>
</ul>
