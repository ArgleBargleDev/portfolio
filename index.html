<h1 id="about">üí¨ About</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Ian Green, a Game Designer who has been working at <b><a href="https://www.gearsforbreakfast.com/">Gears for Breakfast</a></b> from late 2017 to 2022. During my tenure I worked on <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hat_in_Time">A Hat in Time</a></b> until 2019, and their <b>Second Game</b> (no official name yet) from 2019 onward.</p>

<p>At Gears for Breakfast I specialized in a few different fields that were grouped into the title of Technical Designer. These being: gameplay design, level design, documentation/specification, prototyping, programming, UI design, dialogue writing, and a little bit of 2D and 3D art sprinkled in there for good measure.</p>

<p>In this document you will find a sample of my work at Gears for Breakfast, primarily my 2018-2019 work on A Hat in Time, since the Second Game is still under a non-disclosure agreement. All of the work from A Hat in Time was done using Unreal Engine 3, while the Second Game was made using Unreal Engine 4/5.</p>

<h1>üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Design</h1>

<p>Listed below is a collection of some of the gameplay design work I did at Gears for Breakfast! In addition to designing these, I also implemented a lot of them myself, since I wore a few different hats at the company.</p>

<h1>üìë Documentation</h1>

<p>These are some examples of design documentation written for features in A Hat in Time!</p>

<p>The way I write design docs is "thorough but flexible", leaving out specific numbers and not over-detaling features, and focusing more on the design intent. A lot can change over the course of development, and I figure the role of a design doc is to be more of a reference point than a step-by-step guide.</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller;"><i>For legal reasons, this is not the real documentation used for these features, but a simulation of what the documentation would have looked like if it were written in 2022.</i></p>

<a href="docs/cat-trains.html" class="project">
<img src="images/tile_cattrain.png">
<div class="date">2018</div>
<h6>Nyakuza Metro: Cat Trains</h6>
The Cat Trains are snake-like moving platforms that are the cornerstone mechanic of Nyakuza Metro. This documentation covers the movement of the trains, player interaction, placement of the tracks, and much more!

<h6>Arctic Cruise: Ship Shape Minigame</h6>
This minigame leads the player around a cruise ship while carrying a wobbling tower of items. This documentation covers all the systems and mechanics involved, and how they all fit together.

<h1>üé® Art & Writing</h1>

<p>At Gears for Breakfast I did a variety of art and writing, but I haven't filled out this section yet... Check back later!</p>

<!--<p>At Gears for Breakfast I mostly made highly functional placeholders (aka "programmer art"), but I'm also a pretty good style mimic, so I made quite a few of the cosmetics for A Hat in Time as well! ((TODO: rewrite this blurb to include writing))</p>

<p>For examples of my level art and layouts, scroll back up to the <a href="#level">Level Design</a> section!</p>
